# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data
Course Project for Coursera Getting And Cleaning Data

Overview
========
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Code
====
The R script (run_analysis.R) performs data clean up through merging various data sources, matching related variables, and manipulating the values to achieve desired computation. Please proceed to read the CodeBook for more details on this script.

There is another README.txt in the folder UCI HAR Dataset that explains what the data represents.
